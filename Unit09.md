**Unit 9: Renaissance Ideas** <span id="9"></span> 
**The advent of the Renaissance marked the end of the medieval period
and the beginning of the early modern world.  Evidence of this
transition could be seen in the fields of philosophy, art, architecture,
and science.  Many thinkers looked to classical sources as a reference
point: they wanted to both emulate and improve upon the ideas of the
classical world.*  
  
 *In this unit, we will see how an emphasis on realism and rationalism
was manifest in cathedrals, poetry, scientific treatises and paintings
during the Renaissance era.**
