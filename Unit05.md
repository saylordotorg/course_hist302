**Unit 5: Medieval Science, Technology, and Culture** <span
id="5"></span> 
**The Middle Ages were once termed the “dark ages,” but in recent
decades, scholars have increasingly challenged this popular belief as
outdated.  We now know that the Middle Ages was a period of brilliant
cultural and intellectual achievement that laid the foundation for the
Renaissance and the rise of Western Civilization.  Supported by the
Church and the universities it founded, medieval scholars pioneered the
scientific method of offering rational proofs to explain natural
phenomenon.  Cistercian monks developed and spread new methods of
agriculture including selective breeding of plants and animals.  The
great Gothic cathedrals of Europe illustrate this era’s achievements in
engineering and architecture.  Monks and nuns copied and spread the
works of their Greek and Roman predecessors as well as countless
religious texts.  In the visual arts, music, theater, and literature
medieval men and women expressed themselves and their vibrant,
passionate lives.**

**5.1.2 Intellectual Life** <span id="5.1.2"></span>

    (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Read the selection from Peter Abelard’s “Sic et Non”
    to understand the methods of early scholasticism.  
        
     Peter Abelard (1079–1142) taught theology at the University of
    Paris, where he was instrumental in introducing scholastic method to
    the curriculum.  Scholasticism uses Aristotelian logic to explain
    known truths, but in “Sic et Non,” Abelard’s scholastic masterpiece,
    he presents both sides of an issue and expects his students to use
    logic to determine which side has the better case.  Because it left
    out the answers, Abelard’s book became controversial and open to
    attack, and eventually, it was condemned by the papacy.
