**Unit 1: The End of the Roman Empire** <span id="1"></span> 
**The Roman Empire reached its zenith during the second century. 
However, the problems of administering such a vast territory and its
diverse peoples, the lack of a coherent means of imperial succession,
and a succession of weak emperors resulted in a series of crises.  In
order to better manage the sprawling territory in the Mediterranean,
Emperor Diocletian split the Roman Empire into eastern and western
halves in 285.  Forty-five years later, this division was further
entrenched when Emperor Constantine founded a new capital
city—Constantinople—in the eastern empire.  During the next several
centuries, the western Roman Empire was plagued by financial problems, a
shrinking army, and barbarian invasions.  In 410, Rome was invaded by
the Visigoths—a Germanic tribe in Spain—and in 476 Emperor Romulus
Augustulus was deposed by the Germanic leader Odoacer.  While Justinian
I, emperor of the eastern Roman Empire, was able to regain power over
many territories in the West, the western Roman Empire continued
effectively ceased to exist.*  
  
 *During this time, the eastern empire—also known as Byzantium—was
plagued by its own problems.  Though Justinian I—the last Latin-speaking
emperor—had enlarged the empire and codified legislative power, his
death marked the beginning of a period of political turmoil and the
arrival of the bubonic plague.  Invasions from the Persians in the east
and from the Lombards in the west created an uncertain future for
Byzantium.  Struggles against the Muslim world, including the siege of
Constantinople in 717-718, plunged Byzantium into a period known the
“dark ages.”  Although Byzantium did regain much of its former prestige
under Macedonian rule, challenges from the Turks, internal conflicts,
and skirmishes precipitated by the Crusades eventually brought the
empire to its knees in the thirteenth century.*  
  
 *In this unit, we will consider the divergent paths of the western and
eastern portions of the Roman Empire between the fourth and the
fourteenth centuries.  We will study how the end of antiquity paved the
way for the emergence of the medieval world.**

    topic?  2) In what ways were the barbarian invasions relatively

     This code is a collection of fundamental works in jurisprudence,
    originally written in Latin, and issued by Justinian I, Eastern
    Roman Emperor, between 529 and 534 C.E.  The document did not
    contain any new laws; it instead codified all existing imperial
    Roman pronouncements, dating back to the time of Hadrian in the
    second century.  The code spurred a new interest in Roman law that
    would last until the end of the Middle Ages.  As you read, ask
    yourself the following study questions:  1) What were the main
    achievements of Justinian’s rule?  2) How did Justinian’s campaigns

    of Jerusalem, a city important to Christianity, to the non-Christian
    Persians in 614.  Later in the century, the Persians would lose the
    city to a new group, the Muslims.
