**Unit 6: Medieval Society** <span id="6"></span> 
**Medieval society was characterized by three “estates:” the nobles, the
clergy, and the commoners.  As one author of the time put it: “some
pray, others fight, still others work.”[**[1]**](#_ftn1)  This ideal
often masked deep inequities, but medieval estates were not social
classes in the modern sense.  They represented status and rights rather
than wealth so that there were wealthy commoners and poor nobles, rich
clergy, and poor clergy.  Social mobility was limited by modern
standards, but estates were not fixed and many people of high ability
were able to better themselves and their families through luck and hard
work.*  
  
 *Chivalry—the culture of knighthood—became an important component of
medieval society.  And feudalism—a hierarchical system of lords,
vassals, and serfs—became a more formal socio-political regime in Europe
during this time.  Faith played a central role in the lives of medieval
men and women.  The Cluny reforms stimulated a growth in lay piety that
was reflected in new cultural forms such as Gothic art and architecture
as well as an intellectual flowering.  For example, scholasticism, the
attempt to reconcile Christian theology with ancient classical
philosophy, emerged in the twelfth century.  *  
  
 *In this unit, we will study the rise of feudal society in many
European kingdoms.   We will also consider the cultural renaissance of
the High Middle Ages.*
