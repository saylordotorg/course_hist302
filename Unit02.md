**Unit 2: Formation of Latin Christendom** <span id="2"></span> 
**After the fall of the Roman Empire, a number of diffuse Germanic
kingdoms—the Visigoths, Ostrogoths, Burgundians, and Lombards—filled the
power vacuum left by the bureaucratic Roman regime.  Christianity, too,
filled the void left by the Roman Empire as the Germanic kings began to
convert from paganism.  But it was the Frankish Empire that emerged as
the dominant state in medieval Western Christendom.  Beginning in the
ninth century, Charlemagne formed the Carolingian Empire by uniting much
of modern-day France and also extended his holdings into western Germany
and northern Italy.  Scholarship and learning flourished under
Charlemagne’s rule and ushered in the period known as the “Carolingian
Renaissance.”  However, the empire collapsed in the 840s as a result of
Viking and Magyar invasions.  One of the lasting impacts of the
Carolingian world was manoralism—the system wherein peasants held land
from the lord of an estate in exchange for money or agricultural
goods—which was an important component in the development of
feudalism.*  
  
 *In this unit, we will consider the many barbarian kingdoms that
flourished in western, central, and eastern Europe.  We will also
consider the spread of Christianity and monasticism among these
peoples.  Specifically, we will study the rise and fall of the
Carolingian Empire, the most important state to emerge in the Early
Middle Ages.**

    [“Germania”](http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/tacitus-germania-excerp.html)
    Excerpts (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Read Tacitus’ “Germania” for an early Roman view of
    the Germanic tribes and their origins.  
        
     Tacitus, a prominent Roman historian, conducted an ethnographic
    study of the Germanic peoples at the end of the first century.  His
    account gives one of the earliest descriptions of the culture of the
    Germanic tribes—ancestors of modern Teutonic nations—during the
    period when they first came into contact with the Mediterranean
    civilization of the Roman Empire.  However, Tacitus warned that his
    work was as much a commentary on Germania as it was on his native
    Rome.

     Theodoric was the grandson of the Ostrogoth Alaric, who sacked Rome
    in 410.  Theodoric was King of the Ostrogoths from 493 to 526 and
    was very different from his grandfather.  As a child, Theodoric had
    been given to the Romans as a hostage, and he grew up in
    Constantinople and took on Roman culture and understandings of
    government.  As king, he used Roman institutions and traditions of
    rule.

    pontificate?
