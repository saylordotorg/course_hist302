This course will introduce you to the history of the European Middle
Ages and Renaissance.  You will learn about the major political,
economic, and social changes that took place between the fourth century
and 1500.  The course is structured chronologically.  Each unit includes
representative primary-source documents that illustrate important
overarching political, economic, and social themes, such as the collapse
of the Roman Empire, the rise of the Christian Church, the emergence of
the feudal system, the advent of the Renaissance in Italy and northern
Europe, and the significance of the European Age of Exploration.  By the
end of the course, you will understand how Europe transformed from a
collection of barbarian kingdoms into a continent with a sophisticated
cultural and economic life that would later come to dominate the globe.

### Course Information

Welcome to HIST302.  Below, please find some general information on the
course and its requirements.

**Course Designer:** John Radzilowski, PhD and [Dr. Warren
Dym](http://www.saylor.org/faculty-a-g/#DrWarrenDym)

**Primary Resources:** The web resources available for medieval history
are increasingly rich and varied.  The course draws from a wide range of
sources, but relies heavily on the following materials:

-   Fordham University’s *[Internet Medieval
    Sourcebook](http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/sbook.asp) *and
    *[Internet Ancient History
    Sourcebook](http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/asbook.asp)*
-   The ORB: *[The Online Reference Book for Medieval
    Studies](http://www.the-orb.net/)*
-   Yale University’s [The Avalon Project](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/)

**Requirements for Completion:** In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials. 
Pay special attention to Unit 1, as this unit lays the groundwork for
understanding the more advanced, exploratory material presented in the
latter units.  You will be assessed on what you have learned in this
course with a multiple choice Final Exam.  Note that you will only
receive an official grade on your Final Exam. 

In order to “pass” this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher on
the Final Exam.  Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as you
complete it.  If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.

**Time Requirements: **This course should take about **133 hours** to
complete, not counting the Final Exam.  Each unit includes a “time
advisory” that lists the amount of time you are expected to spend on
each subunit.  These should help you plan your time accordingly.  It may
be useful to take a look at these time advisories and to determine how
much time you have over the next few weeks to complete each unit, and
then to set goals for yourself.  For example, Unit 1 should take you 10
hours.  Perhaps you can sit down with your calendar and decide to
complete subunit 1.1 (a total of 3.5 hours) on Monday and Tuesday
nights; subunit 1.2 (a total of 3.5 hours) on Wednesday and Thursday
nights; etc.

**Tips/Suggestions:** The syllabus is organized by units with relevant
material under each subsection.  It is recommended but not required to
complete the units in the order they are presented.  It is recommended
that you take detailed notes as you work through the materials in each
unit.  You may also choose to write down the answers to any study
questions in the instructions section for each resource.  Having these
answers and your notes readily available will serve as a good reference
to study from as you prepare to take the Final Exam.
