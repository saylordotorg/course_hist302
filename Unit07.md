**Unit 7: The Late Middle Ages** <span id="7"></span> 
**While historians usually characterize the High Middle Ages as a period
of prosperity and social advancement, the Late Middle Ages, by contrast,
was a marked by pandemic disease, famine, death, and recurrent warfare. 
The Great Famine of 1315-1317 wreaked havoc over Europe but the arrival
of the Black Death unleashed unparalleled devastation.  Perhaps as much
as half the European population succumbed to the pandemic by 1420. 
While the disease was originally thought to be a bacterium transmitted
by fleas and rats from Asia, new research suggests that “The Great
Plague” might instead have been a viral hemorrhagic fever.  The late
medieval period was also witness to problems within the Catholic
Church.  During the Great Schism, from 1378 to 1417, two men—one in Rome
and one in Avignon, France—simultaneously claimed to be the true Pope. 
The schism divided Europe and undermined the authority of the papacy. 
 And the Hundred Years’ War broke out when France attempted to
confiscate English lands in the duchy of Aquitaine; the conflict dragged
on for 116 years, ending only when France finally expelled England from
the continent.*  
  
 *In this unit, we will consider the death and dislocation unleashed
during the late medieval period.  We will also study how political,
social and religious turmoil caused massive changes in medieval
society.**

    had changed a great deal over the course of the thirteenth century. 
    When Boniface tried to punish Philip IV of France for taxing the
    clergy, Philip simply put the pope on trial and convicted him of
    blasphemy and sorcery, among other trumped-up charges.
