**Unit 8: Origins of the Renaissance** <span id="8"></span> 
**In Italy during the late Middle Ages, the contours of a new cultural
movement—the Renaissance—began to emerge in urban centers such as Rome,
Venice, Florence, and Milan.  Meaning “rebirth” in French, “the
Renaissance” refers to a growing interest in classical Greek and Roman
sources, an emphasis on realism in art, and educational reform. 
Renaissance thinkers emphasized humanism—a moral philosophy that
considers humans to be of primary importance—in art, philosophy,
politics, science, and religion.   This new interest in humanism
represented a gradual shift away from the focus on theology and
philosophy that had dominated European thought for centuries.  By the
sixteenth century, Renaissance culture had spread to other regions of
Europe.**
