**Unit 4: The High Middle Ages** <span id="4"></span> 
**Between the eleventh and thirteenth century, Europe entered a period
known as the High Middle Ages.  The absence of the bubonic plague and
the rise of commerce created an environment for many changes in politics
and society.  Many European kingdoms became more stable polities after
the period of “barbarian invasions;” kings centralized and Christianized
their territories.  This unit presents a geographic overview of Europe
from Spain to the Urals during this crucial period of the 1200s and
early 1300s. **

    the twelfth century.  She was definitely the wealthiest.  She
    inherited a third of France from her father, and in 1137 she married
    the future Louis VII, King of France.  In 1152, Eleanor met Henry,
    Count of Anjou, the heir apparent to the English throne, and
    divorced Louis to marry Henry, taking the Aquitaine and all of her
    other feudal possessions with her. In this letter Peter of Blois
    tries to dissuade Eleanor from divorcing Louis.
