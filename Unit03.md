**Unit 3: Resurgence of Latin West** <span id="3"></span> 
*By the tenth century, medieval empire-building had reached new heights
and Germanic and Frankish monarchs held considerable power and
prestige.  The Catholic Church also extended its power during this
period; church reforms and the threat of Islamic expansion renewed the
Church’s authority in European politics and society.  The Crusades—a
series of religious wars launched to restore Christian control of the
Holy Land—which began in 1096, were the most conspicuous sign of the
rise and expansion of Christian Europe. *  
  
 *In this unit, we will examine the early medieval era in the wake of
the collapse of the Carolingian Empire.  We will study the relative
political and economic stability of the eleventh and twelfth centuries
and the rising tensions between Islam and Christianity.*

     Liudprand of Cremona (c. 922-972) was the bishop of Cremona in

    Otto I.  In 963, Liudprand went to Constantinople to try to secure a
    marriage between Otto’s son and a Byzantine princess.  As Liudprand
    recounts, his mission was unsuccessful, largely because the
    Byzantine emperor and his family saw Otto as an upstart.  Liudprand
    returned home humiliated.

    did.  
        
     Thomas Aquinas was a Dominican who taught theology at the
    University of Paris in the middle of the thirteenth century.  He,
    therefore, looked at the question of commerce from the point of view
    of religion.  The other two documents, the promissory note and the
    purchase order, are actual records of medieval business
    transactions.

     Innocent III, pope from 1198 to 1216, was an Italian by birth and
    had lived in Rome, Paris, and Bologna by the time he was elected
    pope.  Thus, he was very familiar with the commercial culture of
    Europe’s large urban centers, but he also developed a concern about
    the economic relations between Christian Europe and the Islamic
    world.

    of specific trades.  Each major industry in the city would have its
    own guild.  In Florence, for example, there were seven major guilds
    and fourteen minor ones.  The *Arte della Lana* was the Florentine
    wool guild, which held a great deal of power in the city because the
    wool trade was the mainstay of the Florentine economy.

     Instructions: Read the “Foundation Charter of Cluny” to learn about
    the types of monastic reform that took place in the period leading
    up to the Investiture Controversy.  
        
     Count William of Auvergne founded the monastery at Cluny in France
    in 910 with the intention of reforming the Benedictine Order and
    returning it to its roots.  William took the novel step of releasing
    the monastery from all feudal obligations; this meant that Cluny
    Abbey answered only to the pope and not to a secular, or “lay,”
    lord.  He and the monks believed that this arrangement would give
    the monks the freedom to follow Benedict’s Rule in its original form
    without outside interference.

    the Cat, and the Investiture Controversy” to gain an understanding
    of the issues involved in the Investiture Controversy.  
        
     The “Decree of 1059” was meant to reform papal elections by giving
    the right to elect the pope to the College of Cardinals, a body of
    the most eminent members of the Catholic clergy.  Before this, the
    College acted primarily as a group of advisors to the pope.

     Instructions: Read these letters between Pope Gregory VII and the
    Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV to understand the developments of the
    Investiture Controversy.  Read “The Concordat of Worms” and think
    about the ways in which it solves the problems of lay investiture. 
    Also, as you read, consider the ways in which Pope Gregory’s action
    during the Investiture Controversy helped to create the independence
    of the Church from the state.  
        
     Henry IV became King of Germany on his father’s death in 1056, when
    Henry was only six years old.  When Henry became an adult, Gregory
    VII refused to crown him Holy Roman Emperor, because Henry insisted
    on his right to choose the bishops within the empire, and Gregory
    actually deposed Henry in 1076.  The resulting conflict outlived
    both Henry and Gregory and was not resolved until the Concordat of
    Worms of 1122.

     Innocent III, pope from 1198 to 1216, studied law at the University
    of Bologna, Europe’s pre-eminent legal faculty, before becoming
    pope.  As pope, he used canon law (church law) to bolster his
    arguments and his position.  In 1215 he called an ecumenical
    council, the Fourth Lateran Council, to rule on issues and problems
    of the church.  What was the significance of the Fourth Lateran
    Council?

     Instructions: Read “The Great German Pilgrimage of 1064-65” for an
    understanding of Christian-Muslim relations in the period before the

     A pilgrimage is a religious journey, often to a place of religious
    significance or to visit religious objects.  In the eleventh
    century, Europeans became increasingly interested in going on
    pilgrimages to the Holy Land, most of which was under Islamic
    control.  
        
     As you read, keep the following questions in mind: 1) Why did
    European interest in pilgrimages increase in the 1000s?   2) How did
    conflicts in the Islamic Middle East make pilgrimages more
    difficult?
